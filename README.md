- 👋 Hi, I’m @ErrorBot1122
- 👀 I’m interested in coding/playing Roblox and Mincraft
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C#, Python, and Java???
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on javascript repos
- 📫 How to reach me... you can't...

P.S. Sadlly I usually code with my school chromebook and I most likely use (gitpod)[gitpod.io] to code so some links may be block :(
